# TRANSCODE OPTIONS
# a directory named FORCETRANSCODE is required for transcoding (any video in this folder will be transcoded) and seek_dir above is required too.
# (to block seek files generation while  maintain transcode disable enable_seek below).   
# only ffmpeg.exe is used for transcoding. For fast forward and rewind when transcoding a seek_dir contains files to simulate ff/rw, 
# normal ff/rw controls on TV will not work. 
# install ffmpeg.exe in the same directory of the minidlnad.exe ( install most recent STATIC build from https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
# for hardware encoding (amd Vce, intel Qsv or nvidia Nvenc) a 64 bits ffmpeg static build is required for 64 bit Windows.   
# basic comands explained (for more details and examples read README.txt or ffmpeg documentation):
# $STARTPOSITION $SOURCE  $DURATION are internal required variables used by minidlnad.exe (initial position of the movie, name of the movie and duration)
# -copyts is required for transcoding seek with subtitles.
# -sub_charenc CP1252 is the character encoding (code page)of the .srt subtitles files. If .srt subtitles are not burned by ffmpeg or burned with wrong characters, 
# check the code page of the .srt file and adjust the sub_charenc (CP1252 accept ANSI, UNICODE and UTF-8 subtitles). Link to valid charenc codes:
# https://trac.ffmpeg.org/attachment/ticket/2431/sub_charenc_parameters.txt  
# -f mpegts is the format of the stream (mpegts is compatible with most dlna devices) change to avi if no image is displayed when transcoding.
# for other possible formats check README.txt or ffmpeg documentation. This stream format must be compatible with video codec and audio codec.
# -c:v libx264 -preset superfast -crf 26  are the parameters for x264 encoder with bitrate compatible with most wifi networks and
#  CPUs, video bitrate will be 2-3 Mbps for full hd movie.
# for higher video quality (and  higher video bitrate) lower the crf value (crf 23 or other). 
# for faster CPU change preset to increase quality (preset medium or fast or faster). For old and slower CPU change to ultrafast or change video codec to mpeg2video
# additional parameters needed for some TV: -pix_fmt yuv420p (force 8 bit encoding, some TV not support 10 bit)  -profile:v high -level:v 4.1 (some TV not support h264 level > 4.1)
# -c:a aac is the audio codec.  Number of channels is the same of the input. Audio codec E-AC3 JOC ONLY CONVERTS TO AC3, NOT AAC ("Joint Object Coding" its a hybrid that used both the standard AC3/EAC3/DD+/TrueHD AND Atmos)
# pipe:1 used by minidlnad.exe to capture the output of ffmpeg.exe. 


   
#FFMPEG TRANSCODING OPTIONS
#IMPORTANT: for long lines of commands, add a second line (starting with: transcode_video_options= ) or transcode will  fail
#audio: audio codec E-AC3 JOC ONLY CONVERTS TO AC3, NOT AAC
#additional parameters needed for some TV: -pix_fmt yuv420p (force 8 bit encoding, some TV not support 10 bit)  -profile:v high -level:v 4.1 (some TV not support h264 level > 4.1)
#AUDIO STREAMS SELECTION: ffmpeg choose audio track by higher bitrate, number of channels,etc. To force selection of first track of audio, use -map 0:a:0.
# map parameter: -map 0:v:0 ->select first video track of first input file (0=first input file,v=video,0=first video track)    -map 0:a:0->select first input file (0),a=audio, 0=first audio track.
# to select second audio track, change to -map 0:a:1 and so  on (1=second audio track,2=third,etc)
